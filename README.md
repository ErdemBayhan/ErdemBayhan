# Hi there, I'm Erdem Bayhan 👋

[cite_start]I am a motivated and open-minded student currently pursuing an MSc in Artificial Intelligence at the Berlin School of Business and Innovation. [cite_start]I have a strong foundation in Electrical & Electronics Engineering  [cite_start]and hands-on experience from TÜBİTAK-supported deep learning projects. [cite_start]I am actively practicing these skills by coding in Python and am eager to apply my knowledge in an Artificial Intelligence role.
