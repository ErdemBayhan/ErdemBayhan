### üöÄ Projects
Here are some of the key projects I've worked on. You can find more details and the source code in their respective repositories.

ü§ñ AI Language Assistant:
A Python desktop application developed to make language learning fun and memorable. The app uses the Google Gemini API for sentence generation, the Vertex AI API for creating absurd visual mnemonics, and OpenCV for camera-based word recognition. The UI was built with Tkinter, utilizing asyncio to manage background AI tasks and prevent freezing.

üìù AI-Powered Exam Proctoring System:
Designed and deployed an AI-powered system on Google Cloud to ensure academic integrity during online exams. This real-time system leverages computer vision and audio analysis, using YOLOv8 to detect unauthorized items and MediaPipe for head-pose and gaze tracking to identify potential cheating behaviors.

üöó Intelligent Roundabout Navigation System:
Developed an autonomous driving system using a custom YOLOv8 model for object detection (achieving an 0.84 mAP-50 score) and YOLOPv2 for lane segmentation. A Hierarchical State Machine processes this visual data to manage driving logic and make real-time STOP/WAIT/GO decisions in various traffic scenarios.

ü©∫ Breast Cancer Prediction with Machine Learning:
Developed various classification models, including Logistic Regression, SVM, and KNN, to predict the malignancy of breast tumors. After performing model tuning using GridSearchCV, the optimized SVM model achieved a high performance with an AUC-ROC score of 0.99.


üí≥ Credit Card Fraud Detection:
Developed machine learning models to detect fraudulent credit card transactions on a real-world dataset. To address the significant class imbalance inherent in the data, the SMOTE oversampling technique was implemented to enhance model performance. The Random Forest model demonstrated the best overall performance across a comprehensive suite of evaluation metrics.

üö∂ Unimpeded Walking with Deep Learning:
A T√úBƒ∞TAK-funded project to aid visually impaired individuals in navigating outdoors. The system provides real-time voice guidance by using an SSD MobileNet V2 model to detect 11 common objects with 0.93 accuracy, and leveraging Hough's Transform to track tactile paving surfaces. Google Text-to-Speech was used for the audio output.
